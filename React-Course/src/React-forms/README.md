# React Hook Forms Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use React Hook Forms to build forms in React applications. React Hook Forms is a lightweight and flexible library for managing form state in React using hooks.

## What is React Hook Forms?

- React Hook Forms is a library for managing form state in React applications. 
- It provides a simple and intuitive API for building forms with minimal boilerplate code. 
- React Hook Forms uses React hooks to manage form state, making it easy to integrate with functional components.

## Installation

To get started with React Hook Forms, you can install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install react-hook-form

# Using yarn
yarn add react-hook-form
```

# React Hook Form Methods and Features

| Method/Feature       | Description                                                                                       | Usage                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `useForm`             | Initializes the form and returns methods and state for managing form data and validation.        | Call `useForm()` hook in your functional component to initialize the form.                 |
| `register`            | Registers an input field with the form, enabling its value to be tracked and validated.          | Use `register()` to associate input fields with the form.                                  |
| `handleSubmit`        | Handles form submission events and invokes the provided callback function with form data.        | Apply `handleSubmit()` to the form's `onSubmit` event and provide a callback function.      |
| `errors`              | Object containing validation errors for form fields.                                             | Access `errors` object to display validation errors in the form.                            |
| `setValue`            | Sets the value of an input field programmatically.                                               | Use `setValue()` to set the value of an input field dynamically.                           |
| `watch`               | Watches for changes in specific form fields and returns their current values.                    | Call `watch()` to monitor changes in specific input fields.                                 |
| `trigger`             | Manually triggers validation for specific form fields.                                            | Use `trigger()` to manually trigger validation for specific fields.                         |
| `reset`               | Resets the form, clearing all fields and validation errors.                                       | Call `reset()` to reset the form to its initial state.                                      |
| `getValues`           | Returns the current values of all form fields.                                                     | Use `getValues()` to retrieve the current values of all form fields.                        |
| `setError`            | Sets validation errors for specific form fields programmatically.                                 | Call `setError()` to set validation errors for specific fields dynamically.                 |
| `clearErrors`         | Clears validation errors for specific form fields programmatically.                               | Use `clearErrors()` to remove validation errors for specific fields dynamically.             |
| `handleSubmit`        | Handles form submission events and invokes the provided callback function with form data.        | Apply `handleSubmit()` to the form's `onSubmit` event and provide a callback function.      |
| `useFormContext`      | Provides access to form methods and state from nested child components.                           | Use `useFormContext()` to access form methods and state from nested child components.        |
| `Controller`          | Component wrapper for integrating external controlled components with React Hook Form.            | Wrap controlled components with `Controller` and specify `render` and `rules` props.         |
| `useFieldArray`       | Manages arrays of fields within a form, providing methods to add, remove, and manipulate items.  | Use `useFieldArray()` hook to manage dynamic lists or arrays of form fields.                 |

These are some of the common methods and features provided by React Hook Form. They enable developers to build flexible and efficient forms in React applications with minimal boilerplate code.
