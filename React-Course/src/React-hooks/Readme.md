| Hook            | Description                                                                                      | Common Use Cases                                                                                  |

| `useState`      | Allows functional components to manage state.                                                    | Managing local component state, such as form inputs, toggles, and UI state.                      |
| `useEffect`     | Performs side effects in function components.                                                    | Fetching data from an API, subscribing to external events, updating the DOM after rendering.      |
| `useContext`    | Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually.| Accessing global state, themes, and configurations across multiple components.                   |
| `useReducer`    | Alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic.                                 | Managing state transitions, complex form state, and state dependencies.                           |
| `useRef`        | Provides a way to reference mutable values that persist across renders.                          | Accessing and interacting with DOM elements, managing focus, and integrating with third-party libraries. |
| `useCallback`   | Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders in child components.                         | Optimizing performance by memoizing event handlers and callback functions.                        |
| `useLayoutEffect`| Similar to `useEffect`, but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.                           | Manipulating the DOM synchronously, measuring DOM elements before they're painted.                 |
| `useMemo`       | Memoizes expensive computations and prevents unnecessary re-renders.                               | Memoizing derived data, optimizing performance by caching computed values.                         |
| `useDebugValue` | Provides custom labels for custom hooks in React DevTools.                                        | Adding debugging information to custom hooks for easier debugging in React DevTools.                |
