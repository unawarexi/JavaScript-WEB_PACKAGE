## Vite Project Structure

After running `create vite@latest`, the basic project structure includes the following files and directories:

### index.html

The main HTML file that includes a <div id="app"></div> which serves as the mounting point for your React app.

### src/

Contains the source code for your React application.

- #### src/main.jsx
  The entry point for the React application. It typically includes the `ReactDOM.render()` method to render the main App component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("app")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

- #### src/App.jsx
  The main App component. This is where you will start building your React components.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello Vite + React!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- #### src/.css files
  A CSS file to include global styles for your application.

### package.json

Lists the project dependencies and scripts for running and building the project.

### vite.config.js

The configuration file for Vite. Here you can customize the Vite build process.
